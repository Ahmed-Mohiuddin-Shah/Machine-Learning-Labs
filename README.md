# Machine-Learning-Labs  
This repository contains the Machine Learning labs, assignments, and projects completed during the **CS 471: Machine Learning** course at the **National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)**. It includes various exercises, data preprocessing, machine learning techniques, and visualizations implemented as part of the course objectives.

### **Assignments**
- **Assignment 1â€“3**: Practical implementation of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.  

### **Artifacts**
- Visualizations, model artifacts, and experiment logs stored in `mlartifacts` and `screenshots`.

## **Key Features**  
- **DVC Integration**: Dataset version control for efficient tracking of changes in data.  
- **Poetry for Dependency Management**: Manage libraries and environments for consistency.  
- **MLFlow Tracking**: Logs experiment details for reproducibility and analysis.  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Created using libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Plotly`, and `Geopandas`.  

## **Dependencies**  
Make sure to install the necessary dependencies using Poetry:  
```bash
poetry install
```

## **Tools and Libraries Used**  
- **Python (3.10.11)**  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **ML Tools**: DVC, MLFlow, Plotly, Geopandas  

## **Getting Started**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Mohiuddin-Shah/Machine-Learning-Labs.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Labs
   ```
2. Set up the environment:  
   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```
3. Explore the labs and assignments: Open any `.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or VSCode.  

## **Lab 14 Highlights**  
- **Objective**: Hub identification in a global flight network using centrality measures (closeness and betweenness).  
- **Techniques Used**: Graph analysis, feature engineering, Random Forest regression.  
- **Results**: Identified critical hubs, visualized networks, and achieved reasonable predictive performance.
